## The Concept

It is 2021 and all is well in the world\.

Until someone decided to steal Canada’s supply of Maple Syrup\.

Now the world is on the cusp of extinction \– Canada having waged war on the world for taking their syrup\. Elon  Musk has escaped to his Super Secret Colony on Mars but in his haste had left behind ONE spaceship\.

A group of survivor's race against each other to get to the last available spaceship in order to leave the hell that Earth has become and find a place to live for themselves out in the stars\. Each player will have to run through the map in the hopes of reaching the end before any of the other players\.

Along the way there will be obstacles to be avoided, food and supplies to give you a boost in health/stamina and weapons that can be used to sabotage your opponents\. 

Whoever reaches the dropship last gets left behind\. 

There will also be completely randomly generated extinction events at some point in the game \(i\.e\. meteor, solar flare, firestorm, flood\) and if the player isn’t ready, they will lose all their progress\.

Each level will end up with one player left behind until a winner emerges\.

The winner becomes the sole owner of the last human spaceship on Earth\.

The game will be a 2D side scrolling game using pixel art style graphics\.
